# Why?

1. I work on MacOS and I found that it was introducing a "extra" directory into the `.mcpack` file when I was doing it manually, which would cause the pack to fail silently when imported
2. The process of establishing a `.mcpack` is a lot of boiler plating and easy to make mistakes.
3. The only other tools I could find where Windows based - using Windows?  Then go use one of those.
